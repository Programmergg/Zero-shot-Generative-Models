# Zero-shot-Gnerative-Models
In this repository, we showcase a wide range of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAEs) methods applied to the Generalized Zero-shot Learning task.

Here, we have omitted the creation of the datasets. Please refer to other Generalized Zero-shot Learning papers for dataset downloads and place them in the "datasets" folder.
Our framework is suitable for APY, AWA1, AWA2, CUB (with 312-dim attributes or 1024-dim attributes), FLO and SUN. The relevant experiments have been conducted.
