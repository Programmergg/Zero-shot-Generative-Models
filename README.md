# Zero-shot-Gnerative-Models
In this repository, we showcase a wide range of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAEs) methods applied to the Generalized Zero-shot Learning task.

Here, we have omitted the creation of the datasets. Please refer to other Generalized Zero-shot Learning papers for dataset downloads and place them in the "datasets" folder.
